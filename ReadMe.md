## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Repo for course tidy data project.

### Overview
This project demonstrates the ability to download a large data wearable sensor data set, pull specific information (mean and SD), merge the desired data, and output a text file with the requested information


###  Summary
The project is as follows:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
